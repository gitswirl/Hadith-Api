I jumped on her and had intercourse with her. The next morning I went to my people and told them, and said to them: 'Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for me.' They said: 'We will not do that, lest Allah reveal Quran concerning us or the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) says, something about us, and it will be a lasting source of disgrace for us. Rather we will leave you to deal with it yourself. Go yourself and tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about your problem.' So I went out and when I came to him, I told him what happened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Did you really do that?' I said: 'I really did that, and here I am, O Messenger of Allah. (ﷺ) I will bear Allah’s ruling on me with patience.' He said: 'Free a slave.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I do not own anything but myself.' He said: 'Fast for two consecutive months.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the thing that happened to me was only because of fasting.' He said: 'Then give charity, or feed sixty poor persons.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truttu we spent last night with no dinner.' He said: 'Then go to the collector of charity of Banu Zuraiq, and tell him to give you something, then feed sixty poor persons, and benefit from the rest",

So he went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and found that Qur'an had been revealed concerning them, and the Prophet (ﷺ) told them to go through the procedure of Li'an. 'Uwaimir said: 'O Messenger of Allah, (ﷺ) by Allah if I take her back, I would have been telling lies about her.' So he left her before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) told him to do so, and that became the Sunnah for two who engage in the procedure of Li'an. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child who is black in color with widely-spaced dark eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he was telling the truth about her, but if she gives birth to a child with a red complexion like a Wahrah,[1] then I think that he was lying.'

And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her).

Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?\" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence. On the fifth time, meaning that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth, they said to her: \"It will invoke the wrath of Allah.\" Ibn 'Abbas said: \"She hesitated and backed up, until we thought that she was going to recant. Then she said: 'By Allah, I cannot dishonor my people for ever.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child with black eyes, fleshy buttocks and big calves, then he is the son of Sharik bin Sahma'.' And she gave birth to such a child.

A man said: \"I will buy them for two Dirham.\" So he gave them to him and took the two Dirham, which he gave to the Ansari and said: \"Buy food with one of them and give it to your family, and buy an axe with the other and bring it to me.\" So he did that, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) took it and fixed a handle to it, and said: \"Go and gather firewood, and I do not want to see you for fifteen days.\" So he went and gathered firewood and sold it, then he came back, and he had earned ten Dirham. (The Prophet (ﷺ)) said: \"Buy food with some of it and clothes with some.\" Then he said: \"This is better for you than coming with begging (appearing) as a spot on your face on the Day of Resurrection. Begging is only appropriate for one who is extremely poor or who is in severe debt, or one who must pay painful blood money.”",

Can I repent?” He said: “Woe to you, what is stopping you from repenting? Leave the evil town where you are living and go to a good town, such and such town and worship your Lord there.” So he went out, heading for the good town, but death came to him on the road. The angels of mercy and angels of punishment argued over him.

This man who was killed in the early days of Islam is like Sheep that come to drink but stones are thrown at them, so the last of them runs away (i.e. ,the murderer should be killed).' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'You will have fifty (camels) while we are traveling and fifty (camels) when we return.' So they accepted the blood money.”",

He came to the Jews and said: “By Allah, you killed him.” They said: “By Allah, we did not kill him.” Then he went back to his people and told them about that. Then he and his brother Huwayyisah, who was older than him, and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, came (to the Prophet (ﷺ)). Muhayyisah, who was the one who had been at Khaibar, went and he began to speak, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Let the elder speak first.” So Huwayyisah spoke, then Muhayyisah spoke. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Either (the Jews) will pay the blood money for your companion, or war will be declared on them.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent a letter to that effect (to the Jews) and they wrote back saying: “By Allah, we did not kill him.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to Huwayyisah, Muhayyisah and Abdur-Rahman: “Will you swear an oath establishing your claim to the blood money of your companion?” They said: “No” He said: “Should the Jews swear an oath for you?” They said: “They are not Muslims.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) paid the blood money himself, and he sent one hundred she-camels to them and some of them entered the house. Sahl said: “A red she-camels from among them kicked me.”",

Say: ‘Allah directs (thus) about those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs.’” [4:]",

I heard him say: “What the son or father acquires goes to his. ‘Asabah, no matter who they are.’” So he ruled in our favour and wrote a document to that effect, in which was the testimony of ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf, Zaid bin Thabit and someone else. Then when ‘Abdul-Malik bin Marwan was appointed caliph, a freed slave of hers (Umm Wa’il’s) died, leaving behind two thousand Dinar. I heard that that ruling had been changed, so they referred the dispute to Hisham bin Isma’il. We referred the matter to ‘Abdul-Malik, and brought him the document of ‘Umar. He said: ‘I thought that this was a ruling concerning which there was no doubt. I never thought that the people of Al-Madinah would reach such a state that they would doubt this ruling. So he ruled in our favour, and it remained like that afterwards.”",

He (ﷺ) said: ‘Fight in the Name of Allah and in the cause of Allah. Fight those how disbelieve in Allah. Fight but do not be treacherous, do not steal from the spoils of war, do not mutilate and do not kill children. When you meet your enemy from among the polytheists, call them to one of three things. Whichever of them they respond to, accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Invite them to accept Islam, and if they respond then accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Then invite them to leave their land and move to the land of the polytheists. Tell them that if they do that, then they will have the same rights and duties as the polytheists. If they refuse, then tell them that they will be like the Muslim Bedouins (who live in the desert), subject to the same rulings of Allah as the believers. But they will have no share of Fay’* or war spoils, unless they fight alongside the Muslims. If they refuse to enter Islam, then ask them to pay the Poll-tax. If they do that, then accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. But if they refuse, then seek the help of Allah against them and fight them. If you lay siege to them and they want you to give them the protection of Allah and your Prophet, do not give them the protection of Allah and your Prophet, rather give them your protection and the protection of your father and your Companions, for if you violate your protection and the protection of your fathers, that is easier than violating the protection of Allah and the protection of His Messenger. If you lay siege to them and they want you to let them come out with a promise of the judgement of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ), do not offer them a promise of the judgement of Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ), rather offer them your judgement, because you do not know if you will actually pass (the same as) Allah’s judgement regarding them or not.’” Another chain reports a similar hadith",

We said: ‘There are only five (days) until ‘Arafah. Will we g out to it with our male organs dripping with semen?’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘I am the most righteous and truthful among you, and were it not for the sacrificial animal, I would have exited Ihram.’ Suraqah bin Malik said: ‘Is this Tamattu’ for this year only or forever?’ He said: ‘No, it is forever and ever.’”",

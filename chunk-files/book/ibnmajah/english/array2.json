When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis, he would often lift his face towards the heavens, and Allah knew what was in the heart of His Prophet and how he longed to face the Ka’bah (during prayer). Jibril appeared (in the sky), and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) started watching him as he was descending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to see what he would bring. Then Allah revealed the words: ‘Verily, We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (during prayer) in that direction.’ [2:144] Then someone came to us and said: ‘The Qiblah has been changed to the Ka’bah.’ We had performed two Rak’ah facing towards Jerusalem. And we were bowing. So we turned around, and we continued our prayer. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘O Jibril! What about our prayer facing towards Baitul- Maqdis?’ Then Allah revealed the words: “And Allah would never make your faith to be lost.” [2:]",

By Allah, you did not follow him more than we did, and you did not accompany him for longer.’ He said: ‘Yes I am.’ They said: ‘Show us.’ He said: ‘When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up for prayer, he would say the Takbir, then he would raise his hands parallel to his shoulders, and every part of his body would settle in place. Then he would recite, then he would raise his hands parallel to his shoulders and bow, placing his palms on his knees and supporting his weight on them. He neither lowered his head, nor raised it up, it was evenly balanced (between either extreme).

Then he would stand up and do the same in the next Rak’ah. Then when he stood up after two Rak’ah, he would raise his hands level with his shoulders as he did at the beginning of the prayer.

The allies of Quraish stayed at the house of Mughirah bin Shu’bah, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) camped Bani Malik in a tent belonging to him. He used to come to us every night after the ‘Isha’ and speak to us standing on his two feet, until he started to shift his weight from one foot to the other. Most of what he told us was what he had suffered from his people, the Quraish. He said: ‘(The two sides) were not equal. We were weak and oppressed and humiliated, and when we went out to Al-Madinah, the outcome of the battles between us varied; sometimes we would defeat them and sometimes they would defeat us.’ One night he was later than he usually was, and I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you have come to us late tonight.’ He said: ‘It occurred to me that I had not read my daily portion of Qur’an and I did not want to come out until I had completed it.’” Aws said: “I asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ‘How did you used to divide up the Qur’an?’ They said: ‘A third, a fifth, a seventh, a ninth, an eleventh, a thirteenth, and Hizbul-Mufassal.’”",

He said:“I lay down across the pillow and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his wife were laying along it. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept until midnight, or a little before, or a little after. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up and began to rub the sleep from his face with his hand. Then he recited the last ten Verses of Surah Al ‘Imran. Then he got up and went to a water skin that was hanging up and performed ablution from it, and he performed ablution well, then he stood up and prayed.” ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas said: “I stood up and did what he had done, then I went and stood beside him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) put his right hand on my head, took hold of my right ear and tweaked it. Then he prayed two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then two Rak’ah, then he prayed Witr. Then he lay down until the Mu’adh-dhin came to him and he prayed two brief Rak’ah, then he went out to pray.”",

When they put the pulpit in place, they put it in the place where it stands now. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wanted to stand on the pulpit, he passed by the tree trunk from which he used to deliver the sermon, and when he went beyond the trunk, it moaned and split and cracked. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came down when he heard the voice of the trunk, and rubbed it with his hand until it fell silent. Then he went back to the pulpit and when he prayed, he prayed facing it. When the mosque was knocked down (for renovation) and (the pillars, etc.) were changed, Ubayy bin Ka’b took that trunk and kept it in his house until it became very old and the termites consumed it and it became grains of dust.”",

Like a person eating raisins and spitting out the seeds. He used to go around among his wives, but when he became ill, he asked them permission to stay in the house of ‘Aishah and that they should come to him in turns.’ She said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me, (supported) between two men, with his feet making lines along the ground. One of them was ‘Abbas.’ I told Ibn ‘Abbas this Hadith and he said: ‘Do you know who the other man was whom ‘Aishah did not name? He was ‘Ali bin Abu Talib.’”",

By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has indeed died.’ ‘Umar was in a corner of the mosque saying: ‘By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has not died and he will never die until the hands and feet of most of the hypocrites are cut off.’ Then Abu Bakr stood up, ascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. “Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will give reward to those who are grateful.’” [3:144] ‘Umar said: ‘It was as if I had never read (that Verse) before that day.’”",

They sent two messengers to both of them, and they said: ‘O Allah, choose what is best for Your Messenger.’ They found Abu Talhah and brought him, but they did not find Abu ‘Ubaidah. So he dug a grave with a niche for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When they had finished preparing him, on Tuesday, he was placed on his bed in his house. Then the people entered upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in groups and offered the funeral prayer for him, and when they finished the women entered, and when they finished the children entered, and no one led the people in offering the funeral prayer for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Muslims differed concerning the place where he should be buried. Some said that he should be buried in his mosque. Others said that he should be buried with his Companions. Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “No Prophet ever passed away but he was buried where he died.” So they lifted up the bed of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on which he had died, and dug the grave for him, then he (ﷺ) was buried in the middle of Tuesday night. ‘Ali bin Abu Talib, Fadl bin ‘Abbas and his brother Qutham, and Shuqran the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went down in his grave. Aws bin Khawli, who was Abu Laila, said to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib: ‘I adjure you by Allah! Give us our share of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ So ‘Ali said to him: ‘Come down.’ Shuqran, his freed slave, had taken a Qatifah which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to wear. He buried it in his grave and said, ‘By Allah, no one will ever wear it after you.’ So it was buried with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).”",

At the time of the new date-palm harvest, they would take a bunch of dates that were beginning to ripen and hang it on a rope between two of the pillars in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and the poor emigrants would eat from it.” One of them deliberately mixed a bunch containing rotten and shriveled dates, and thought this was permissible because of the large number of dates that had been put there. So the following was revealed about the one who did that: '… and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it'. Meaning do not seek out the rotten and shriveled dates to give in charity: '…(thought) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein.' Meaning, if you were given this as a gift you would only accept it because you felt embarrassed, and you would get angry that he had sent something of which you have no need. And know that Allah has no need of your charity.”",

No woman can fulfill her duty towards Allah until she fulfills her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.' ”",

I went to her, and I did not know what she wanted. She took me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house, and I was panting. When I got my breath back, she took some water and wiped my face and head, and led me into the house. There were some woman of the Ansar inside the house, and they said: 'With blessings and good fortune (from Allah).' (My mother) handed me over to them and they tidied me up. And suddenly I saw the Messenger of Allah in the morning. And she handed me over to him and I was at that time, nine years old.”",

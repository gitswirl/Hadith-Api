Abu Eisa said: The Hadith of 'Ali is a Hasan Sahih Hadith, regarding which there are narrations from four of the Tabi'in narrating it from each other. This is acted upon according to some of the people of knowledge. Ash-Shafi'i said: \"This is the most correct thing on this topic\" This Hadith abrogates first Hadith: \"Whenever you see a funeral (procession), stand up [for it].\" Ahmad said: \"If he wants, he stands, and if he wants, he does not stand.\" His proof is that it has been reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) stood, then sat, and this is what Ishaq bin Ibrahim said. (Abu Eisa said:) As for the saying of 'Ali: The Prophet (ﷺ) stood for the funeral and then sat, he means that the Prophet (ﷺ) would stand when he saw a funeral (procession), then he did not do so later, so he would not stand when he saw the funeral (procession)",

If one of us saw his wife committing adultery what should he do? If he were to say anything, his statement would be a horrible matter, and if he were to remain silent, his silence about the matter would be horrible.\" \"He said: 'So the Prophet remained silent and did not answer him. Afterwards he came to the Prophet and said: \"The one who asked you about it has been tried by it.\" So Allah revealed these Ayat from Surat An-Nur. And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves - until the end of those Ayat. So he called for the man and recited the Ayat to him and admonished him, reminded him, and he told him: \"Indeed the punishment of the world is less than the punishment of the Hereafter.\" So he said: \"Nay! By the One Who sent you with the truth! I did not lie about her.\" Then he did the same with the woman, admonished her and reminding her and he told her: \"Indeed the punishment of the world is less than the punishment of the Hereafter.\" She said: \"Nay!

And, it carries the meaning of him loaning it to him in exchange for something (as collateral), so he says: 'If you are unable to pay it (the loan), the it (the collateral) will be a sale for you.' Ishaq [bin Rahuwyah] said as he said. And I said to Ahmad: 'What about selling what one does not possess?' He said: 'To me it does not apply except in cases of food - meaning one has not taken possession of it.' And Ishaq said the same for all of what is measured or weighed. Ahmad said: 'When he says: \"I will sell you this garment, with the condition that I am the tailor for it, and I am the one who bleaches it.' This is an example of two conditions in one sale. But if he says: \"I am selling it to you with the condition that I am its tailor,\" then there is no harm in it. And, if he said: \"I am selling it to you with the condition that I am the one who bleaches it\" then there is no harm in it, because this is only one condition.' And Ishaq said as he said",

This is acted upon according to the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others, except for what has been related from Ibn 'Abbas; he did not see any harm in exchanging gold for gold or silver for silver, more for less, when it is done hand in hand, and he said: \"Riba' is only in credit.\" Similar it has been related from some of his companions. It has been related that Ibn 'Abbas changed his opinion when Abu Sa'eed narrated it to him from the Prophet (ﷺ). The first view is more correct. And this is acted upon according to the people of knowledge [among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others]. It is the view of Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq.

If they spoke the truth and clarified (any defects or conditions), then they would be blessed in their sale, and if they hid something and lied then their sale would be deprived of blessings.\" And this is a Sahih Hadith. This is how it was reported from Abu Barzah Al-Aslami, that two men came disputing to him after the sale of a horse, and they were on a ship, so he said: \"I did not see the two of your separate, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The buyer and the seller retain the choice as long as they did not separate.'\" Some of the people of knowledge, among the people of Al-Kufah and others, held the view that the separation refers to speech. This is the saying of [Sufyan] Ath-Thawri. This has been reported from Malik bin Anas, and it has been reported from Ibn al-Mubarak that he said: \"How could this be refuted ?\" And the Hadith about it from the Prophet (ﷺ) is Sahih, and it strenghtens this view. And the meaning of the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): \"Except for the optional sale\" is, that (while they are still together) the seller gives the buyer the option to cancel after the conclusion of the sale. If he chooses to agree to the sale, then he does not have the choice to cancel the sale after then, even if they did not separate. This is how Ash-Shafi'i and others explained it. And what strenghtens the view of those who said that the separation refers to them parting, (and) it does not refer to speech, is the (following) Hadith of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr from the Prophet (ﷺ)",

Some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and others thought that delay in delivery of animals is allowed. This is the view of Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq.

So Salman went to them and said: 'I am only a man from among you, a Persian, and you see that the Arabs obey me. If you become Muslims then you will have the likes of what we have, and from you will be required that which is required from us. If you refuse, and keep your religion, then we will leave you to it, and you will give us the Jizyah from your hands while you are submissive.' He said to them in Persian: 'And you are other than praiseworthy and if you refuse then we will equally resist you.' They said: 'We will not give you the Jizyah, we will fight you instead.' So they said: 'O Abu 'Abdullah! Should we charge them?' He said: 'No.'\" He said: \"So for three days he called them to the same (things), and then he said: 'Charge them.'\" He said: \"So we charged them, and we conquered the castle",

It is for the Imam to decide to be generous with whom he wills among the captives, or to kill whom he wills among them, or to ransom whom he wills among them. Some of the people of knowledge preferred killing over ransoming. Al-Awzai' said: \"It has been conveyed to me. that this Ayah is abrogated: Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (to free them without ranson) or ransom (47:4). It was abrogated by: Kill them wherever you find them (2:191). This was narrated to us by Hannad (who said): \"Ibn Al-Mubarak narrated to us, from Al-Awza'i.\" Ishaq bin Mansur said: \"I said to Ahmad: 'When the captives are captured' is killing or ransoming better to you?' He said: 'If they are able to ransom' then there is no harm in it. And if they kill, then I do not know of any harm in it.'\" Ishaq said: \"Wiping them out is better to me, unless it is someone well-known, so that it is hoped that a large amount will be obtained for him",

And the meaning of his saying: \"I haven been prohibited from the Zabd (gifts) of the idolaters\" is their gifts. It has been reported about the Messenger (ﷺ) that he used to accept the gifts of the idolaters while a dislike for that is mentioned in this Hadith. And the implication is that this was after he used to accept from them, and then he later forbade their gifts",

He pressed his vein closed and it did not bleed a drop before they surrendered to the arbitration of Sa'd bin Mu'adh.

With this, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'You have judged according to Allah's judgement for them.' And they were four hundred.

If I were killed in the cause of Allah, would my sins forgiven ?\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Yes, If you are killed in Allah's cause, and you are patient, seeking the reward, advancing, not fleeing.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"What was it that you said?\" So he replied: \"If I were killed in the cause of Allah, would my sins be removed (forgiven)?\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Yes, If you are patient, seeking the reward, advancing, not fleeing - except debt.

For indeed it is more appropriate so that he not scorn Allah's favors [upon him].\" And it has been related from 'Awn bin 'Abdullah who said: \"I accompanied the rich, and did not see anyone with more troubles than me.

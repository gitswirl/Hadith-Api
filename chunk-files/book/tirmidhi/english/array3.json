Indeed I have a great deal of wealth and I do not have any heirs except my daughter, so should I will all of my wealth?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then two-thirds of my wealth?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then half?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then a third' He said: 'No.' A third and a third is too much. If you leave your heirs without need it is better than to leave them in poverty begging from the people. Indeed you do not do any spending (on your family) except that you are rewarded for it, even the morsel of food you raise to your wife's mouth.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Will I be left behind from my emigration?' He said: 'You will not be left behind after me,and do righteous deeds intending Allah's Face, except that it will add to your elevation in rank. Perhaps you will remain until some people benefit from you and others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels. But the case of Sa'd bin Khawlah is sad.'\" the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) felt sorry for him dying in Makkah",

He narrated that (in the beginning) trust was preserved in the roots of the hearts of men, then the Qur'an was revealed, and they learned it from the Qur'an, and then they learned it from the Sunnah. Then he narrated to us about the disappearance of trust, saying, 'A man will go to sleep whereupon trust will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, like speckles. He then will sleep, whereupon the remainder of the trust will also be taken away and trace will remain like a blister, like an ember that you roll on your feet, it causes pain and you see it swollen while it contains nothing.' Then he took a pebble and rolled it over his leg. He said: 'So there will come a day when people will deal in business with each other, but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons among them, such that it would be said that in such and such a tribe, there is such and such person, who is honest, and until a man will be admired for his strength, intelligence, and good manners, although indeed he will not have faith equal to a mustard seed in his heart.\"' He (Hudhaifah) added: \"There came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating me, and if was a Jew or a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating me; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so",

And among what he said was: 'The awe(status) of people should not prevent a man from saying the truth when he knows it.\"'He(one of the narrators) said: \"Abu Sa'eed wept, then he said: 'By Allah! We have seen things and we feared.\"' \"And among what he said in it, was : 'Indeed, for every treacherous person there shall be a banner erected on The Day Of Resurrection in proportion to his treachery. And there is no treachery greater than the treachery of a leader to the masses' whose banner shall be positioned at his buttocks.' And among what we remember from that day is: 'Behold! Indeed the children of Adam were created in various classes. Among them is he who was born a believer, lives as a believer, and dies a believer. Among them, is he who was born a disbeliever, lives as a disbeliever, and dies a disbeliever. Among them, is he who was born a believer, lives as a believer, and dies a disbeliever. Among them, is he who was born a disbeliever, lives as a disbeliever, and dies a believer. Behold! Among them is the slow to get angry, the quick to calm. Among them is the quick anger and the quick to calm, so this is with that. Behold! Among them is the quick get angry and the slow to calm, and indeed the best of them is the slow to get angry and the quick to calm, and the worst of them is the quick get angry and the slow to calm. Behold! Among them is he who pays back well and collects well. Among them is he who is bad with paying back and good when collecting. Among them is he who pays back well and is bad with collecting, so this is with that. Behold! Among them is he who is bad with paying back and bad with collecting. Indeed the best of them is the one who is good in paying back and good in collecting. And the worst of them is the one who is bad with paying back and bad with collecting. Behold! Anger is an ember in the heart of the son of Adam, as you see it in the redness of his eyes and the bulge of his jugular veins. So whoever senses something from that, then let him cling to the ground.\"' He said: \"So we began turning towards the sun to see if anything of it remained(meaning whether it has set or not). So the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said: 'Behold! The world, in relation to what has passed of it, shall not remain except as what remains of this day of yours, in relation to what has passed of it",

        "text": "It was narrated from An-Nawwas bin Sam'an, who said:\"The Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) mentioned the Dajjal one morning, he belittled him and mentioned his importance until we thought that he might be amidst a cluster of date-palms.\" He said: \"We departed from the presence of the Messenger of Allah(s.a.w), then we returned to him, and he noticed that(concern) in us. So he said: 'What is wrong with you?'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! You mentioned the Dajjal this morning, belittling him, and mentioning his importance until we thought that he might be amidst a cluster of the date-palms.' He said: 'It is not the Dajjal that I fear for you. If he were to appear while I am among you, then I will be his adversary on your behalf. And if he appears and I am not among you, then each man will have to fend for himself. And Allah will take care of every Muslim after me. He is young, with curly hair, his eyes protruding, resembling someone from 'Abdul-Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, then let him recite the beginning of Surah Ashab Al-Kahf.'\"He said: 'He will appear from what is between Ash-Sham and Al-'Iraq, causing devastation toward the right and toward the left. O worshippers of Allah! Hold fast!'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! How long will he linger on the earth?' He said: 'Forty days, a day like a year, a day like a month, a day like a week, and the remainder of his days are like your days.'\" We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Do you think that during the day that is like a year, the Salat of one day will be sufficient for us?' He said: 'No. You will have to estimate it.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah! How fast will he move through the earth.' He said: 'Like a rain storm driven by the wind. He will come upon a people and call them, and they will deny him, and reject his claims. Then he will leave them, and their wealth will follow him. They will awaken in the morning with nothing left. Then he will come upon a people and call them, and they will respond to him, believing in him. So he will order the Heavens to bring rain, and it shall rain, and he will order the land to sprout, and it will sprout. Their cattle will return to them with their coats the longest, their udders the fullest and their stomachs the fattest.' He said: 'Then he will come upon some ruins, saying to it: \"Bring me your treasures!\" He will turn to leave it, and it will follow him, like drone bees. Then he will call a young man, full of youth, and he will strike him with the sword cutting him into two pieces. Then he will call him, and he will come forward with his face beaming and laughing. So while he is doing that, 'Eisa bin Mariam, peace be upon him, will descend in eastern Damascus at the white minaret, between two Mahrud, with his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops fall, and when raises it, gems like pearls drop from him.' He said: 'His (the Dajjal's) breath does not reach anyone but he dies, and his breath reaches as far as his sight.' He said: 'So he pursues him(the Dajjal) and he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd where he kills him.' He said: 'So he remains there as long as Allah wills.' He said: 'Then Allah reveals to him: \"Take my slaves to At-Tur, for I have sent down some creatures of Mine which no one shall be able to kill.'\" He said: 'Allah dispatches Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and they are as Allah said: They swoop down from every mount.' \"He said: 'The first of them pass by the lake of Tiberias, drinking what is in it. Then the last of them pass by it saying: \"There was water here at one time.\" They travel until they reach a mountain at Bait Al-Maqdis. They will say: \"We have killed whoever was in the earth. Come! Let us kill whoever is in the skies.\" They will shoot their arrows into the Heavens, so Allah will return their arrows to them red with blood. Eisa bin Mariam and his Companions be surrounded, until the head of a bull on that day would be better to them than a hundred Dinar to one of you today.' \"He (s.a.w) said: \"Eisa will beseech Allah, as will his companions.' He said: 'So Allah will send An-Naghaf down upon their necks. In the morning they will find that they have all died like the death of a single soul.' He said: \" 'Eisa and his companions will come down, and no spot nor hand-span can be found, except that it is filled with their stench, decay and blood. So 'Eisa will beseech Allah, as will his companions.' So Allah will send upon them birds like the necks of Bukht(milch)camels.' They will carry them off and cast them into an abyss. The Muslims will burn their bows, arrows and quivers for seventy years.' \"He(s.a.w) said: 'Allah will send upon them a rain which no house of hide nor mud will bear. The earth will be washed, leaving it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the earth: \"bring forth your fruits and return your blessings.\" So on that day, a whole troop would eat a pomegranate and seek shade under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that a large group of people will be sufficed by one milking of a camel. And that a tribe will be sufficed by one milking of a cow, and that a group will be sufficed by the milking of sheep. While it is like that, Allah will send a wind which grabs the soul of every believer, leaving the remainder of the people copulating publicly like the copulation of donkeys. Upon them the Hour shall begin",

Some people among the inhabitants of Palestine traveled by boat in the sea, taking them here and there, until it cast them on an island among the islands at sea. There they found a beast, clothed with its hair flowing out. They said: 'What are you?' It said: 'I am Al-Jassasah.' They said: 'Give us some news.' It said: 'I shall not give you any news, nor do I want any of your news. But go to the furthest village, for there is someone who will give you news and seek your news.' So we went to the furthest village, and there was a man fettered with chains. He said: 'Inform me about the spring of Zughar.' We said: '\tIt is full and flowing.' He said: 'Inform me about Al-Buhairah.' We said,'It is full and flowing.' He said: 'Inform me about the date groves of Baysan which is between Jordan and Palestine, do they produce food?' We said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Inform me about the Prophet, has he been sent?' We said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Inform me how the people came to him.' We said: 'Quickly.' He leaped up to try and escape.' We said: 'What are you?' He said: 'I am the Dajjal.'\" (The Prophet(s.a.w) said) \"He will enter all of the lands except At-Taibah, and At-Taibah is Al-Madinah",

But being filled for a day and hungry for a day\"-or he said: \"three days\" or something like that- \"So when I am hungry, I would beseech You and remember You, and when I am full I would be grateful to You and praise You",

Then he went to a date-palm and returned with a cluster of dates which he put down. The prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Why don't you select some ripe dates for us?\" He said: \"O Messenger of Allah(s.a.w)! I wanted you to select from the ripe dates and the unripe dates.\" So they ate and they drank from that water. The Messenger of Allah(s.a.w) said: \"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! This is among the favors which you shall be asked about on the Day of Judgement. Cool shade, tasty ripe dates, and cool water.\" Abu Al-Haitham left to prepare some food for them.

The Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Choose from them.\" He said: \"O Prophet of Allah! Choose for me.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed the one consulted is entrusted. Take this one for I have seen him praying, and encourage him to do well.\" So Abu Al-Haitham went to his wife and informed her of what the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said. So his wife said: \"You will not fulfill what the Prophet (s.a.w) said until you have freed him.\" So he said: \"He is free.\" So the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"Indeed Allah has not send a Prophet nor made a Khalifah except that he has two groups of supporters, group ordering him to do good, and prohibiting him from evil and a group that never ceases spoiling his affairs.

He asked:\" Who is this?\" They said: \"Abu Hurairah.\" (He said):So I got close to him until I was sitting in front of him as he was narrating to the people. When he was silent and alone, I said to him: \" I ask youabsolute truth if you would narrate to me a Hadith which you heard from the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w), That you understand and know.\" So Abu Hurairah said: \"You want me to narrate a Hadith to you which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated to me that I understand and know.\" Then Abu Hurairah began sobbing profusely. We sat for a while, then he recovered and said: \"I shall narrate to you a Hadith which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated in this House, while there was no one with us other than he and I.\" Then, again, Abu Hurairah began sobbing severely. Then he recovered, and wiped his face, and said: \"you want me to narrate to you a Hadith which the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) narrated while he and I were sitting in this House, and no one was with us but he and I.\" Then Abu Hurairah began sobbing severely. Then he bent, falling on his face, so I supported him for a long time. Then he recovered and said: \"The Messenger of Allah narrated to me that on the Day of Judgement, Allah, Most High, will descend to His slaves t judge between them. Every nation shall be kneeling. The first of those who will be called before him will be a man who memorized the Qur'an, and a man who was killed in Allah's cause, and a wealthy man. Allah will say to the reciter: 'Did I not teach you what I revealed to My Messenger?\" He says: 'Of course O Lord!' He says: 'Then what did you do with what you learned?' He said: 'I would stand (in prayer reciting) with it during all hours of the night and all hours of the day.' Then Allah would say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say: 'You have lied.'Allah will say to him: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is a reciter. And that was said.' The person with the wealth will be brought, and Allah will say to him: 'Was I not so generous with you, such that I did not leave you having any need from anyone?' He will say: 'Of course O Lord!' He says: 'Then what did you do with what I gave to you?' He says: 'I would nurture the ties of kinship and give charity.' Then Allah will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah, Most High, will say: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is so generous, and that was said.' Then the one who was killed in Allah's cause shall be brought, and Allah will say to him : 'For what were you killed?' So he says: 'I was commanded to fight in Your cause ,so I fought until I was killed.' Allah [Most High] will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah [Most High] will say: 'Rather, you wanted it be said that so-and-so is brave, and that was said.' \"Then the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w)hit me on my knees and said: 'O Abu Hurairah! These first three are the creatures of Allah with whom the fire will be enflamed on the Day of Judgement.'\" Al-Walid Abu 'Uthman Al-Mada'ini said: \"So 'Uqbah bin Muslim informed me that Shaufaiy, is the one who entered upon Mu'awiyah to inform him about this.\" Abu Uthman said: 'This has been done with these people, then how about with those who remain among the people?\" Then Mu'awiyah begin weeping so intensely, that we thought that he will kill himself with excessive weeping. We said: \"This man came to us to cause evil.\" Then Mu'awiyah recovered, wiped off his face and said: \"Allah and His Messenger told the truth: Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, then we shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they shall have no diminution therein. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter Fire, and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do",

Ask,so that you may be granted and intercede so that your intercession may be accepted.\" I will raise my head and say: \"O Lord! My Ummah! O Lord! My Ummah! O Lord! My Ummah!\" He will say: \"O Muhammad! Let those of your Ummah who have no accounts enter the gate on the right among the gates of Paradise, and they shall share in the gates other than that with the people.'\" Then he (s.a.w) said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul!

And By Allah, the One Whom there is none worthy of worship besides Him – I would lay on the ground on my liver (side) due to hunger, And I would fasten a stone to my stomach out of hunger. One day I sat by the way that they (the Companions) use to come out through. Abu Bakr passed and so I asked him about an Ayah from Allah's Book, not asking him except that he might tell me to follow him (for something to eat). But he passed on without doing so. Then `Umar passed, so I asked him about an Ayah from Allah's Book, not asking him except that he might tell me to follow him. But he passed on without doing so. Then Abul-Qasim (s.a.w) passed, and he smiled when he saw me, and said: 'Abu Hurairah?' I said: 'I am here O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Come along.' He continued and I followed him, he entered his house, so I sought permission to enter, and he permitted me. He found a bowl of milk and said: 'Where did this milk come from?' It was said: 'It was a gift to us from so – and – so.' So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'O Abu Hurairah' I said: 'I am here O Messenger of Allah!' He said: 'Go to the people of As-Suffah to invite them.' - Now, they were the guests of the people of Islam, they had nothing of people nor wealth to rely upon. Whenever some charity was brought to him, he would send it to them without using any of it. And when a gift was given to him (s.a.w), he would send for them to participate and share with him in it. I became upset about that, and I said (to myself): 'What good will this bowl be among the people of As-Suffah and I am the one bringing it to them?' Then he ordered me to circulate it among them (So I wondered) what of it would reach me from it, and I hoped that I would get from it what would satisfy me. But I would certainly not neglect to obey Allah and obey His Messenger, so I went to them and invited them. When they entered upon him they sat down. He said: 'Abu Hurairah, take the bowl and give it to them.' So I gave it to a man who drank his fill, then he gave it to another one, until it ended up with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w), and all of the people had drank their fill. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) took the bowl, put it on his hand,then raised his head. He smiled and said: 'Abu Hurairah, drink.' So I drank, then he said: 'Drink.' I kept drinking and he kept on saying, 'Drink.' Then I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth! I have no more space for it.' So he took the bowl and praised Allah, mentioned His Name and drank.'” (Sahih)",

So the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'If you were to be in that condition when you depart from me, the angels would have surely visited you in your houses. And if you did not sin, Allah would surely have brought anew creation that they may sin, so that then He may forgive them.'\"He said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! From what was the creation created?' He said: 'From water.' We said: 'Paradise, what is it constructed of?' He said,'Bricks of silver and bricks of gold. Its mortar is musk of a strong fragrance, and its pebbles are pearls and rubies, and its earth is saffron. Whoever enters it shall live and shall not suffer, and shall feel joy and shall not die, nor shall their clothes wear out, nor shall their youth come to an end.' Then he said: 'Three persons , their supplication is not rejected: The just ruler, the fasting person when he breaks his fast, and the supplication of the wronged person. It is raised up above the clouds, and the gates of Heaven are opened up for it, and the Lord, Blessed and Exalted says: I shall surely come to your aid, even if after a time",

Then permission shall be granted to them to visit their Lord, for the length of a Friday from the days of the world. He shall present for them His Throne and He shall manifest the gardens of Paradise. Then lofty seats of light shall be erected for them, and lofty saets of pearl, and lofty seats or corundum, and lofty seats of peridots, and lofty seats of gold, and lofty seats of silver. And the lowest of them- and there is none of them that is low- shall sit upon a dune of musk and camphor, and they shall not regard those upon the chairs as having a better sitting place than them.' Abu Hurairah said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, and will we see our Lord?' He (S.a.w) said: 'Yes.[He said: ] Do you doubt [concerning] seeing the sun, or the moon on a night when it is full?' We said: 'No.' He said: 'Likewise, you will not doubt concerning seeing your Lord. And they shall not remain in that meeting any man except Allah shall give him a lecture until he says to a man from among them: \"O so-and – so son of so - and – so, do you remember the day when you said such-and-such.” And He will remind him of some of his betrayals in the world, so he will say: “O my Lord, did you not forgive me?” So He will say: “Indeed! It is by the vastness of My Forgiveness that you reached this station of yours.” So while they are engaged in this they shall be covered by a cloud that shall rain upon them a perfume, the like of whose smell they have not smelled, ever. And our Lord [Blessed and Exalted is He] shall say: “Arise to what I have prepared for you of generosity, and take whatever you desire.” Then, we will come to a market which the angels will have already surrounded. [In it] shall be what no eyes have seen the like of, nor ears have heard of, nor ever has it occurred in the hearts (of men). And there shall be carried to us whatever we desire. There shall be not be anything sold or bought in this market, and, in that market, the people of Paradise shall meet one another.' He said: 'So the person of high rank shall come and meet the one below him in rank- and there is none among them that is low- so he shall be impressed by the clothes he sees on him, their discussion shall not come to an end until he shall imagine upon himself what is more beautiful than it, and that is because it is not fitting for anyone to feel regret therein. Then we will return to our places and our wives shall meet us saying: “Welcome and greetings, you have come, and you have beauty greater than what you parted us with.” So we will say: “Indeed we sat today with our Lord, the Powerful, and it is fitting that we should return with what we have returned with.'” (Da'if)",

They will follow what they used to worship, and the Muslims will remain. Then the Lord of the Worlds will come to them and say: 'Do you not follow the people?' So they will say: 'We seek refuge in Allah from you, we seek refuge in Allah from you, Allah is our Lord, and we shall remain here until we see our Lord.' And He orders them and makes them firm.'\"Thy said: \"And you will see Him, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said: \"Are you harmed in seeing the moon on the night of a full moon?\" They said: \"No, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"So you will not be harmed in seeing Him at that hour. Then He will conceal Himself, then He will come, and He will make them recognize Him, then He will say: \"I am your Lord, so follow Me.\" So the Muslims will arise and the Sirat shall be placed, and they shall be placed, and they shall pass by it the like of excellent horses and camels and their statement upon it shall be, \"Grant them safety, grant them safety.\" And the people of Fire shall remain, then a party of them shall be cast down into it, and it shall be said (to the Fire): 'Have you become full?' So it shall say: Is there more? Then a party of them shall be cast down into it, and it shall be said: 'Have you become full?' So it shall say: Is there more? Until when they are all included into it, Ar-Rahman (the Most-Merciful) shall place His foot in it and its sides shall be all brought together, then He will say: 'Enough.' It will say 'Enough, enough.' So when Allah, the Exalted, has admitted the people of Paradise into Paradise and the people of Fire into Fire\"- [He said:]- \"Death shall be brought in by the collar and stood on the wall that is between the people of Paradise and the people of the Fire, then it will be said: 'O people of Paradise!' They will come near, afraid. Then it will be said: 'O people of the Fire!' They will come rejoicing, hoping for intercession. Then it will be said to the people of Paradise and the people of the Fire: 'Do you recognize this?' So they will-both of them-say: 'We recognize it. It is Death which was given charge of us,' so it will be laid down and slaughtered upon the wall [the one that is between Paradise and the Fire], then it will be said: 'O people of Paradise! Everlasting life without death!' And 'O people of the Fire! Everlasting life without death",

Fasting is a shield, and charity extinguishes sins like water extinguishes fire - and a man's praying in depths of the night.'\" He said: \"Then he recited: 'Their sides forsake their beds to call upon their Lord.' Until he reached: 'What they used to do.' [32:16-17] Then he said: 'Shall I not inform you about the head of the entire matter, and its pillar, and its hump?' I said: 'Of course O Messenger of Allah! He said: 'The head of the matter is Islam, and its pillar is the Salat, and its hump is Jihad.' Then he said: 'Shall I not inform you about what governs all of that?' I said: 'Of course O Messenger of Allah!'\" He (ﷺ) said: \"So he grabbed his tongue. He said 'Restrain this.' I said: 'O Prophet of Allah! Will we be taken to account for what we say?' He said: 'May your mother grieve your loss O Mu'adh! Are the people tossed into the Fire upon their faces, or upon their noses, except because of what their tongues have wrought",

He said: 'No, I did not come except seeking this Hadith.' So he said: 'Indeed, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: \"Whoever takes a path upon which he seeks knowledge, then Allah makes a path to Paradise easy for him. And indeed the angels lower their wings in approval to the one seeking knowledge. Indeed forgiveness is sought for the knowledgeable one by whomever is in the heavens and whomever is in the earth, even the fish in the waters. And superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon over the rest of the celestial bodies. Indeed the scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, and the Prophets do not leave behind Dinar or Dirham. The only legacy of the scholars is knowledge, so whoever takes from it, then he has indeed taken the most able share",

He sat him down, then he drew a line around him. Then he said: 'Do not go beyond your line, for indeed there shall come some men to you, but do not speak to them for they shall not speak to you.'\" He said: \"Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went to where he wanted to go, and while I was sitting within the line, some men came to me that appeared as if they were from Az-Zut (A dark people, either from North Africa or India. See Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi and An-Nihayah), both their hair and their bodies. I did not see nakedness nor covering. They ended up before me but they did not pass the line. Then they returned toward the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and when it was near the end of the night, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to me while I was sitting, and he said: \"I have been awake watching all night' then he entered into the line with me and lay down on my thigh to sleep. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would snore when he slept. So while I was sitting there, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sleeping (with his head resting) on my thigh, there appeared some men wearing white garments, and Allah knows best just how handsome they were. They came towards me, and a group of them sat at the head of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and a group at his feet. Then they said to each other: 'We have not ever seen a slave (of Allah) who was given the likes of what this Prophet has been given. Indeed his eyes sleep but his heart remains awake. His parable is that of a chief who built a castle, then he placed a table-spread in it, and invited the people to eat from his food and drink. So whoever answers his invitation, he eats from his food and drinks from his drink. Whoever does not answer, he is punished - or he said - he is chastised.' Then they alighted and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) awoke at that time, and said: 'I heard what they were saying. Do you know who they were?' I said: 'Allah and His Messenger know better.' He said: 'They were the angels. Do you know the meaning of the parable they stated?' I said: 'Allah and His Messenger know better.' He said: 'The meaning is that Ar-Rahman [Most Blessed and Most High] built Paradise, and He invited His Slaves to it. Whoever replies he shall enter Paradise, and whoever does not reply, he shall be punished or chastised",

But he was slow in doing so. So 'Eisa said: 'Indeed Allah commanded you with five commandments to abide by and to command the Children of Isra'il to abide by. Either you command them, or I shall command them.' So Yahya said: 'I fear that if you precede me in this, then the earth may swallow me, or I shall be punished.' So he gathered the people in Jerusalem, and they filled [the Masjid] and sat upon its balconies. So he said: 'Indeed Allah has commanded me with five commandments to abide by, and to command you to abide by. The first of them is that you worship Allah and not associate anything with him. The parable of the one who associates others with Allah is that of a man who buys a servant with his own gold or silver, then he says to him: \"This is my home and this is my business so take care of it and give me the profits.\" So he takes care of it and gives the profits to someone other than his master. Which of you would live to have a servant like that? And Allah commands you to perform Salat, and when you perform Salat then do not turn away, for Allah is facing the face of His worshipers as long as he does not turn away. And He commands you with fasting. For indeed the parable of fasting, is that of a man in a group with a sachet containing musk. All of them enjoy its fragrance. Indeed the breath of the fasting person is more pleasant to Allah than the scent of musk. And He commands you to give charity. The parable of that, is a man captured by his enemies, tying his hands to his neck, and they come to him to beat his neck. Then he said: \"I can ransom myself from you with a little or a lot\" so he ransoms himself from them. And He commands you to remember Allah. For indeed the parable of that, is a man whose enemy quickly tracks him until he reaches an impermeable fortress in which he protects himself from them. This is how the worshiper is; he does not protect himself from Ash-Shaitan except by the remembrance of Allah.'\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"And I command you with five that Allah commanded me: Listening and obeying, Jihad, Hijrah, and the Jama'ah. For indeed whoever parts from the Jama'ah the measure of a hand-span, then he has cast off the yoke of Islam from his neck, unless he returns. And whoever calls with the call of Jahiliyyah then he is from the coals of Hell.\" A man said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Even if he performs Salat and fasts?\" So he (ﷺ) said: \"Even if he performs Salat and fasts. So call with the call that Allah named you with: Muslims, believers, worshipers of Allah",

So He (Allah) says: 'Have I wronged you in any of your rights?' They said: 'No.' He says: 'Then it is my blessing that I give to whomever I wish",

I heard this one reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a manner different from how you taught me, and you taught me Surat Al-Furqan.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Release him O 'Umar! Recite O Hisham.' So he recited it for him as I had heard him reciting. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: 'This is how it was revealed.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, 'Recite O 'Umar.'

Some of the people of Hadith have criticized Suhail bin Abi Hazm. [Imam At-Tirmidhi said:] This is how it has been reported from some of the people of knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), and others. They were very stern about this - about explaining the Qur'an without knowledge. As for what has been related from Mujãhid, Qatadah and others, among the people of knowledge, that they would interpret the Qur'an, then it should not be thought about them that they would say something about the Qur'an, or interpret it without knowledge, or according to their own intellect. Rather that which proves what we have said has been reported from them, that they would not say something from themselves without knowledge. Husain bin Mahdi Al-Basri narrated to us (he said: AbdurRazzaq narrated to us, from Ma'mar, from Qatadah who said): \"There is no Ayah in the Qur'an except that I have heard something about it.\" Ibn Abi 'Umar narrated to us (he said): \"Sufyan bin 'Uyainah narrated to us, from Al-A'mash who said: 'Mujãhid said: If you recited the recitation of Ibn Mas'ud, you would not need to ask Ibn 'Abbãs about much of what you ask him regarding the Qur'an",

Sometimes I am behind an Imam.' He said: 'O Ibn Al-Farisi! Then recite it to yourself. For indeed I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: Allah, the Most High said: \"I have divided the Salat between Myself and My slaves into two halves. Half of it is for Me, and half of it for My slave, and My slave shall have what he asks for. My slave stands and says: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of All that exists.\" So Allah, Blessed is He and Most High says: \"My slave has expressed his gratitude to Me.\" He says: \"The Merciful, the Beneficent. So he says: \"My slave has praised Me.\" He says: Owner of the Day of Reckoning. He says: \"My slave has glorified Me. And this is for Me, and between Me and My slave is: It is You alone whom we worship and it is You alone from whom we seek aid\" until the end of the Surah \"This is for My slave and My slave shall have what he asks for.\" So he says: Guide us to the straight path. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed your favor, not those with whom is Your wrath, now those who are astray.\"' [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan. (Other chains of narrations) (Another chain) from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said: \"Whoever performs a Salat in which he does not recite Umm AlQur'an in it, then it is aborted, [it is aborted,] then it is aborted, not complete.\" And in Ismã'il bin Abi Uwais' Hadith there is no more than this.

And I came without having a treaty nor a writ. When I was brought to him, he took my hand. Prior to that he had said: 'I hope that Allah will place his hand in my hand.'\" He said: \"He stood with me, and a woman and a boy met him and said: 'We have a need from you.' He stood with them, until he was finished dealing with what they wanted. Then he took me by the hand until he brought me to his house. A slave girl brought him a cushion to sit on, and I sat in front of him. He expressed thanks and praise for Allah then said: 'What has caused you to flee from saying La Ilaha Illallah? Do you know of another god other than Him?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.'\" He said: \"Then he talked for some time, and then said: 'You refuse to say Allahu Akbar because you know that there is something greater than Allah?'\" He said: \"I said: 'No.' He said: 'Indeed the Jews are those who Allah is wrath with, and the Christians have strayed.'\" He said: \"I said: 'Indeed I am a Muslim, Hanif.'\" He said: \"I saw his face smiling with happiness.\" He said: \"Then he ordered that I stop with him at the home of a man from the Ansar, whom he would frequently visit in the mornings and the evenings. When I was with him at night, a people in woolen garments of these Nimar (a cloth with certain patters, and the word appeared before) came. Then he performed Salat and stood to encourage them (the people) to give (charity) to them. Then he said: 'Even with a Sa' or half a Sa', or a handful or part of a handful, to save the face of one of you from the heat of Hell, or the Fire. And even if it be by a date or a part of a date - for indeed one of you shall meet Allah and it shall be said to him what I say to you: \"Have I not given hearing and seeing to you?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"Have I not given you wealth and children?\" He shall say: \"Of course.\" It will be said: \"So where is what you have sent forth for yourself?\" He will look before him and behind him, on his right and on his left, but he shall not find anything to protect his face from the heat of Hell. Let one of you protect his face from the Fire, even if with part of a date, and if he does not find that, then with a good statement. For indeed I do not fear poverty for you - Allah will aid you and grant you, such that a woman can travel on her camel howda from Yathrib to Al-Hirah, or further, without fear of being robbed.' I began thinking to myself: \"Where would the thieves of Taiy' be then?",

She remained with him as long as she did, then he divorced her once without taking her back until her 'Iddah elapsed, but they desired each other again. He (Ma'qil) said to him: 'You ingrate! I honored you by marrying her to you, then you divorced her. By Allah! She will never be returned to you again.' Allah knew of his heed for her and her need for a husband, so Allah, Blessed and Most High, revealed: 'And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period...' up to His saying: '... and you do not know (2:232).' So when Ma'qil heard that he said: 'I heard my Lord and obey.' Then he called for him and said: 'I marry you, and honor you.'\" [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. It has been reported through other routes from AlHasan, and that is reported from Hasan is Gharib. And in this Hadtth, there is proof that marriage is not allowed without a Wali, because Ma'qil bin Yasãr's sister was not a virgin, so if the matter was up to her, not her Wali, then she could have married herself, and she would have had no need for Ma'qil bin Yasãr to act as the Wali for her. And Allah only addressed the Wali in this Ayah, saying: Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands. - so in this Ayah is the evidence that the authority is with the Wali in marrying (women) with their consent",

Somethings entered their hearts that had not entered before. So they mentioned that to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: 'Say: \"We hear and we obey.\" So Allah put faith into their hearts and Allah Blessed and Most High revealed the Ayah: The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers (and) Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear, for it is what it has earned and against it is what it has wrought. \"Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error (2:286).\" He said: 'I have done so (as requested).' Our Lord! Lay not upon us a burden like that which You did upon those before us. He said: ['I have done so (as requested).'] Our Lord! Put not a burden upon us greater than we have strength for. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us (2:286).

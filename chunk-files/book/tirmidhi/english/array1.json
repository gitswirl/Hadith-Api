He said: Baqiyyah related it from Ibrahim bin Adham from Muqatil bin Hayyan, from Shahr bin Hawshah, from Jarir. This Hadith is explanatory, because some who dislike wiping over the Khuff give the interpretation that the Prophet's wiping over the two Khuff was before the revelation of Sural Al-Ma'idah. But in his Hadlth, Jarir mentions that he saw the Prophet wiping over his Khuff after the revelation of Surat Al-Ma'idah",

So the Prophet said: 'I will order you to do one of two things, which ever of them you do, it will be acceptable for you. You should know which of them you are able to do.' Then he said: 'This is only a blow from Shaitan. Menstruate for six or seven days, which Allah knows, then perform Ghusl. When you see that you have become pure and clean, then perform Salat for twenty-three or twenty-four nights and their days. Perform Salat and fast, and that will be acceptable for you. So do this (if you can) just as (other) women who menstruate and become pure during their periods of menstruation and purity. If (not, and) you are able to delay Zuhr and hasten Asr then perform Ghusl when you have become pure, and pray Zuhr and Asr together. Then delay Maghrib and hasten Isha, then perform Ghusl and combine the two prayers. So do this (if you are able). Then perform Ghusl with the dawn and pray. Do this, and fast if you are able to do so.' Then Allah's Messenger said: 'That is what is preferable to me of the two",

Abu `Eisa said: We do not know of the Hadith of Bilal except as a narration of Abu Isra'il Al-Mula'i. Abu Isra'il did not hear this Hadith from Al-Hakam bin `Utaibah. He said: He only reported it from Al-Hasan bin `Umarah, from Al-Hakam bin `Utaibah. Abu Isra'il's name is [Isma`il bin Abi Ishaq, and he is not strong according to the people of Hadith. The people of knowledge have differed over the interpretation of At-Tathwib. Some of them say that At-Tathwib is when one says \"As-Salatu Khairummin An-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for the Adhan of Fajr. This is the saying of Ibn Al-Mubarak and Ahmad. Ishaq said something different about At-Tathwib, he said: \"[The disliked Tathwib] is something that the people started after the Prophet; when the Mu'adh-dhin calls the Adhan and the people are slow in coming, so between the Adhan and the Iqamah he says: 'Qad Qamatis-Salat, Hayya `Alasalat, Hayya `AlalFalah. (Prayer is ready, come to prayer, come to success.)\" [He said:] This Tathwib, which Ishaq mentioned, is the one that the people of knowledge dislike, which they innovated after the Prophet. But Ibn Al-Mubarak and Ahmad explained that At-Tathwib is when the Mu'adh-dhin says: \"As-Salatu Khairum minan-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for the Adhan of Fajr. And this is the correct saying, and it is called At-Tathawwub as well, and this is the one chosen by the people of knowledge, and it is their opinion. It has been reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he would say: \"As-Salatu Khairum-minan-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for Fajr. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said: \"I entered a Masjid with `Abdullah bin `Umar in which the Adhan was called, and we wanted to pray in it. Then the Mu'adh-dhin said the Tathwib. So `Abdullah bin `Umar left the Masjid and said: 'Let us leave the place of this innovator' And he did not pray in it.\" [He said:] `Abdullah only disliked the Tathwib that the people invented later on",

Then what appeared to be a Bedouin man entered to pray, but he performed his Salat in a very brief manner. He then got up and greeted the prophet with Salam. The Prophet said (returning the greeting): 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have no prayed.' So he returned to perform Salat then came and greeted the Prophet with Salam. So he (the Prophet) said (returning the greeting): 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have not prayed.' [He did that] two or three times, each time coming to the Prophet, greeted the Prophet with Salam and the Prophet saying: 'And upon you. Go back and perform Salat, for indeed you have not prayed.' - until the people got scared and became very worried that one whose prayer was so brief had not actually prayed. Then in the end the man said: 'Then show me, and teach me, for I am a human who has suffered and is mistaken.' So he said: 'Alright. When you stand for Salat then perform Wudu as Allah ordered you. Then say the Tashahhud, and the Iqamah as well. If you know any Quran then recite it, if not then praise Allah, mention His greatness, and the Tahlil. Then bow such that you are at rest in your bowing, then stand completely, then prostrate completely, then sit such that you are at rest while sitting them stand. When you have done that, then you have completed your Salat, and if you leave out something, then you have made your Salat deficient.' And this was easier on them than the first matter, because if some of this was deficient, It would only reduce the reward of his Salat, it would not have gone entirely",

When he died, Abu Bakr implemented it until he died, as did Umar until he died. In it was: 'A sheep (is due) on five camels, two sheeps on ten, three sheeps on fifteen, four sheeps for twenty, a Bint Makhad on twenty-five to thirty-five. When it is more than that, then a Bint Labun, (is due, till the number of the camels reaches) forty-five. When it is more than that, then a Hiqqah until sixty. When it is more than that, then a Jadhah until seventy-five. When it is more than one hundred and twenty, then a Hiqqah on every fifty, and a Bint Labun on every forty. For sheep; one sheep (is due) for every forty sheeps until one hundred and twenty. When it is more than that, then two sheeps until two hundred. When it is more than that, then three sheeps until three hundred sheep. When it is more than three hundred sheep, then a sheep on every hundred sheep. Then there is nothing until it reaches four hundred. There is no combining the (property of) individuals nor separating the collective (property) fearing Sadaqah. And fr whatever is mixed together that two own, then they are to refer to the total. Neither an old or defective (animal) may be taken for charity",

Be calmm.' Then he came to Jama and performed the two Salat there combined. When the morning came, he went to Quzah and stood there and said: 'This is Quzah, and it is a place of standing, and all of Jama is a place for standing.' Then he departed until he arrived at Wadi Muhassir. Then he stuck his she-camel and she trotted until he passed the valley. Then he stopped and took Al-Fadl as a companion rider and went to the Jamrah to stone it. Then he went to Al-Manhar and said: 'This is Al-Manhar, and all of Mina is a place for sacrifice.' A young girl from Khath'am came to ask him for a verdict, she said: 'Indeed my father is an elderly man who has lived until Allah has made Hajj obligatory, so would he be rewarded if I perform Hajj for him? He said: 'Perform Hajj for your father.'\" He said: \"And he turned the neck of Al Fadl. So Al-Abbas said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Why did you turn the neck of your cousin?' He said: 'I saw a young man and a young woman, and they were not safe from Shaitan.' A man came to him and said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I performed (Tawaf) Al-Ifadah before shaving.' He said: 'Shave, and there is no harm'\" - or: 'Clip and there is no harm'\" He said: \"Someone else came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! I did the sacrifice before stoning.' So he said: 'Stone, and there is no harm.'\" He said: \"Then he went to the House (Ka'bah) to perform Tawaf around it, then he went to Zamzam and said: 'O tribe of Abdul-Muttalib!

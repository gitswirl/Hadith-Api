If a person owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah and he does not have one, but he has a Bint Labun, it should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Hiqaah, then it should be accepted from him and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams, or two sheep. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Bint Makhad, then it should be accepted from him, and he should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Makhad as Sadaqah but he only has a Bint Labun, a male; it should be accepted from him, and he does not have to give anything else along with it. If a person has only four camels he does not have to give anything unless their owner wants to. With regard to the Sadaqah on grazing sheep, if there are forty, then one sheep is due upon them, up to one hundred and twenty. If there is one more, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more, then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there are more than that, then for every hundred, one sheep is due. No feeble, defective or male sheep should be taken as Sadaqah unless the Zakah collector wishes. Do not combine separate flocks or separate combined flocks for fear of Sadaqah. Each partner (who has a share in a combined flock) should pay the Sadaqah in proportion to his shares. If a man's flock is one less than forty sheep, then nothing is due from them, unless their owner wishes. With regard to silver, one-quarter of one-tenth, and if there are only one hundred and ninety Dirhams, no Zakah is due unless the owner wishes",

When there are less than twenty-five camels, for every five camels, one sheep (is to be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then a Bint Makhad (a one-year-old she-camel) is due, up to thirty-five. If a Bint Makhad (a one-year-old male camel). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a Bint Labun (a two-year-old she-camel) is due, up to forty five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a Hiqqah (a three year old she-camel) that was bred by a stallion camel is due, up to sixty. If the number reaches sixty-one, then a Jadh'ah (a four-year-old she-camel) is due, up to seventy-five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two Bint Labun are due, up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two Hiqqahs that have been bred by stallion camels are due, up to one hundred and twenty. If there are more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty a Bint Labun and for every fifty a Hiqqah. In the event that a person does not have a camel of the age specified according to the Sadaqah regulation, then if a person owes a Jadh'ah but he has a Hiqqah, then the Hiqqah should be accepted from him and he should give two sheep along with it if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Hiqqah as Sadaqah but he only has a Jadh'ah, then it shold be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams or two sheep. If a person owes a Hiqqah and does not have one but he has a Bint Labun, it should be accepted from him, and he should give two sheep along with it, if they are available, or twenty Dirhams. If a person owes a Bint Labun as Sadaqah but he only has a Hiqqah, it should be accepted from him, and the Zakah collector should give him twenty Dirhams or two sheep.

With regard to the Sadaqah of grazing sheep, if there are forty then one sheep is due, up to one hundred and twenty. If there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that, then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred one sheep is due, and no decrepit or defecting sheep or male sheep should be taken as Sadaqah unless the Zakah collector wishes.

My father sent me to a group of them to bring their Sadaqah to him. I set out and came to an old man who was called Sa'r. I said: My father has sent me to collect the Sadaqah of your sheep. 'He said: O son of my brother, how will you decode what you want to take?' I said\" 'We choose, and we even measure the sheep's udders.' He said: O son of my brother, I tell you that I was in one of these mountain passes at the time of the Messenger of Allah with some sheep of mine. Two men came on a camel and said: We are the messengers of the Messengers of Allah, we come to take the Sadaqah of your sheep. I said: What do I have to give? They said: A sheep. So I went to a sheep that I knew was filled with milk and was fat, and brought it out to them. He said: This is a Shafi - a sheep that has a child or is pregnant - and the Messenger of Allah forbade us to take a Shafi'. So I went to a Mu'tat she-goat - a Mutat is one that has not given birth before, but has reached the age where it could produce young- and brought it out to them. They said: We will take it. So I lifted it up to them, and they took it with them on their camel and left.\"' (Daif)",

Most of them, may all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The face of the Messenger of Allah changed when he saw them in poverty. He went in (to his house) then he came out and ordered Bilah to call the Adhan and then the Iqamah. He (the Prophet) prayed, tjem je addressed te,, (reciting the Verses): 'O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him(Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women: and fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual right), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever and All-Watcher over you.' [1] and: 'Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow,' [2] Then they gave in charity, some giving a Dinar, others a Dirham, or a garment, or a Sa' of wheat or, a Sa' of dates, until he said: 'Even half a date.' A man from among the Ansar came with a bag of money which his hands could hardly lift. The people followed one another (in giving charity) until I saw two heaps of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah shining like gold (with joy). The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever sets a good precedent in Islam, he will have the reward for that, and the reward of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever sets an evil precedent in Islam, he will have a burden of sin for that, and the burden of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest",

People who travel all night until sleep becomes dearer to them than anything that may be equivalent to it, so they lay down their heads (and slept). Then a man among them got up and started praying to Me and beseeching Me, reciting MY Ayat. And a man who was on a campaign and met the enemy and they fled, but he went forward (pursuing them) until he was killed or Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, granted victory to him. And three whom Allah hates are the old man who commits Zina, the poor man who shows off, and the rich man who is unjust",

After he finished circumambulating the House he prayed two Rak'ahs at Maqam Ibrahim. Then he went to As-Safa and walked seven rounds between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. And he did not do any action that was forbidden because of Ihram until he had completed his Hajj and slaughtered his Hadi on the Day of sacrifice. Then he hastened onward (toard Makkah) and circumambulated the House. Then everything that had been forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. And those who had brought the Hadi with them did the same as the Messenger of Allah did",

When he finished, Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. Then we went out with hm and on the day of Arafat. Abu Bakr stood up and addressed people, telling them about rituals.

Then on the day of Sacrifice, we departed (Ifadah) and when Abu Bakr came back, eh addressed the people, telling them about their departure (Ifadah), sacrifice and rituals. When he finished, Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it. On the first day of An-Nafr (The 12th of Dhul-Hijjah), Abu Bakr stood up and addressed the people, telling them how to offer their sacrifice and how to stone the Jamrat, and teaching them their rituals. When he had finished, \"Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and recited the declaration of innocence to the people until he finished it.

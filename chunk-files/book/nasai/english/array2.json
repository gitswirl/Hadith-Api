When he finished, he said to Abu Bakr: 'What stopped you from continuing to pray when I gestured to you?' Abu Bakr, may Allah (SWT) be pleased with him, said: 'It was not appropriate for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in prayer.' Then he said to the people: 'Why did you clap?'

Also among the people was a man with long hands who was known as Dhul-Yadain. He said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), did you forget or has the prayer been shortened? He said: I did not forget and the prayer has not been shortened. He said: Is it as Dhul-Yadain says? They said: yes. So he came and prayed what he had missed, then he said the salam, then he said the takbir and prostrated as usual or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said the takbir, and prostrated as usual or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said the takbir",

I said to him: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On this day, Adam was created, on this day he was sent down, on it his repentance was accepted, on this day he died, and on this day the Hour will begin. There is no living creature on Earth that does not listen out from Friday morning until the sun rises, fearing the onset of the Hour, except the son of Adam. On (Friday) there is an hour in which, if a believer prays and asks Allah for something, He will give it to him. Ka'b said: Is that one day in every year? I said: No, it is every Friday.' Then Ka'b read in the Tawrah and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spoke the truth; it is every Friday. Then I went out and met Basrah bin Abi Basrah Al-Ghifari. He said: From where have you come? I said: From At-Tur. He said: If I had met you before you went there, you would not have gone. I said to him: Why? He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Do not travel especially to visit any masjid except three: Al Masjid Al-Haram (in Makkah), my masjid (in Al-Madinah) and the Masjid of Bait Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem). Then I met 'Abdullah bin Salam and said: 'If you had only seen me, I went to At-Tur and met Ka'b, and he and I spent the day together, when I narrated things to him from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he narrated things to me from the Tawrah. I said to him: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On this day, Adam was created, on this day he was sent down, on this day his repentance was accepted, on this day he died, and on this day the Hour will begin.

On (Friday) there is an hour in which, if a believer prays and asks Allah for something, He will give it to him. Ka'b said: That is one day in every year. 'Abdullah bin Salam said: Ka'b is not telling the truth. I said: Then Ka'b read (in the Tawrah) and said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spoke the truth; it is every Friday. 'Abdullah said: Ka'b spoke the truth; I know when that time is. I said: O my brother, tell me about it. He said: It is the last hour of Friday, before the sun sets. I said: Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If a believer prays, but that is not a time for prayer. He said: Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Whoever prays and sits waiting for the (next) prayer, is in a state of prayer until the next prayer comes? I said: Of course.

Then he stood and praised and glorified Allah (SWT) and said: The sun and moon do not eclipse for the death or birth of anyone, but they are two of the signs of Allah (SWT) with which He strikes fear unto you.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came from his mount and came to his prayer place, and led the people in prayer.He stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he raised his head and stood for a long time, then he bowed for a long time, then he raised his head and stood for a long time, then he prostrated for a long time. Then he stood for a shorter time than in the first (rak'ah), then he bowed for a shorter time than the first, then he raised his head and stood for a shorter time than the first, then he bowed for a shorter time than the first, then he raised his head and stood for a shorter time than the first, so he bowed four times and prostrated four times, and the eclipse ended. He said: \"You will be tried in your graves like the trial of the Dajjal.' Aishah said: 'I heard him after that seeking refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave",

The sun turned black, and we said to one another, let us go to the masjid, for by Allah (SWT) this must herald some event concerning the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and his ummah. We went to the masjid and we saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) coming out to the people. He went forward and prayed. He stood for the longest time that he had ever stood in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he bowed for the longest time that he had ever bowed in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. Then he prostrated for the longest time that he had ever prostrated in any prayer in which he led us, but we did not hear him saying anything. The he did likewise in the second rak'ah. And the eclipse ended as he was sitting at the end of the second rak'ah.

Pray to Allah (SWT ) to stop the rain for us.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'O Allah, around us and not on us, rather on the mountains and places where trees grow.'

Allah (SWT) withheld the latter part of this surah for twelve months, then he revealed the lessening (of this duty) at the end of this surah, so Qiyam Al-Lail became voluntary after it had been obligatory.\" I felt inclined to stand up (and not ask anything further), then I thought of the witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I said: \"O Mother of the Believers, tell me about the witr of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).\" She said: \"We used to prepare his siwak and water for his ablution, and Allah (SWT) would wake him when He wished during the night. He would use the siwak, perform ablution, and then pray eight rak'ahs in which he would not sit until he reached the eighth one.

Then he would pray two rak'as sitting after uttering the taslim, then he would pray one rak'ah, and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son! When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) grew older and put on weight, he prayed witr with seven rak'ahs, then he prayed two rak'ahs sitting down after saying the taslim, and that made nine rak'ahs. O my son, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)offered a prayer, he liked to continue to offer it, and when sleep, sickness, or pain distracted him from praying Qiyam Al-Lail, he would pray twelve rak'ahs during the day. I am not aware of the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) having recited the whole Qur'an during a single night, or praying through the whole night until morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan.\" I went to Ibn 'Abbas and told him what she had said, and he said: \"She has spoken the truth.

'Umar said: 'O Suhaib, do not weep, for I heard the Messenger of Allah say: The deceased is punished due to some of the weeping of his family for him.

Rather I followed you so that I might be shot her - and he pointed to his throat - with an arrow and die and enter Paradise.\" He said: \"If you are sincere toward Allah, Allah will fulfill your wish.\" Shortly after that they got up to fight the enemy, then he was brought to the Prophet; he had pointed to. The Prophet said: \"Is it him?\" They said: \"yes.\" He said: \"He was sincere toward Allah and Allah fulfilled his wish.\" Then the Prophet shrouded him in his own cloak and out him in front of him and offered the (funeral) prayer for him.

When I spoke too much he said: 'I have been given the choice and I have chosen (to offer the prayer for him). If I knew that he could be forgiven by asking Allah's forgiveness more than seventy times, I would have done so.' The Messenger of Allah offered the funeral prayer for him, and then left. A short while later, the two Verses form surah Bara were revealed: 'And never pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were rebellious.' Later I was astonished by my audacity toward the Messenger of Allah on that day.

I was brought a basin of gold, filled with wisdom and faith, and he slit open from the throat to the lower abdomen, and washed the heart with Zamzam water, then - \"it was filled with wisdom and faith. Then I was brought a riding-beast, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey. I set off with Jibril, peace be upon him, and we came to the lowest heaven. It was said: 'Who is with you?' He said: 'Muhammad.' It was said: 'Has (revelation) been sent to him? Welcome to him, what an excellent visit his is.' I came to Adam, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent son and Prophet.' Then we came to the second heaven and it was said: 'Who is this?' He said: 'Jibra'il.' [1] It was said: 'Who is with you?' he said: 'Muhammad.' And the same exchange took place. I came to Yahya and 'Eisa, peace be upon them both, and greeted them, and they said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the third heaven and it was said: 'Who is this?' He said: 'Jibra'il.' It was said: 'Who is with you?' He said: 'Muhammad.' And the same exchange took place. I came to Yusuf, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the fourth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Idris, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the fifth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Harun, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' Then we came to the sixth heaven and the same exchange took place. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent brother and Prophet.' What I passed him, he wept, and it was said: 'Why are you weeping?' He said: 'O Lord, this young man whom You have sent after me, more of his Ummah will enter Paradise than from my nation, and they will be more virtuous than them.' Then we came to the seventh heaven and a similar exchange took place. I came to Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome to you! What an excellent son and Prophet.' Then I was taken up to the Oft-Frequented House (Al-Bait al-Ma'mur) and I asked Jibra'il about it, and he said: 'This is Al-Bait al-Ma'mur in which seventy thousand angels pray everyday, and when they leave it they never come back.' Then I was taken up to Sidrah Al-Muntaha (the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary). Its fruits were like Qilal [2] of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. At its base were four rivers: Two hidden rivers and two manifest rivers. I asked Jibril (About them) and he said: 'The two hidden ones are in paradise, and the two manifest ones are the Euphrates and the Nile.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined upon me. I came to Musa and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined upon me.' He said: 'I know more about the people than you. I tried hard with the Children of Israel. Your Ummah will never be able to bear that. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it for you.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, and He made it forty. Then I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'What happened?' I said: 'He made it forty.' He said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and He made it thirty. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and told him, and he said to me something similar to what he said the first time, so I went back to my Lord and he made it twenty, then ten, then five. I came to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said to me something like he had said the first time, but I said: 'I feel too shy before my Lord to go back to Him.' Then it was called out: 'I have decreed (the reward for) My obligation, and I have reduced the burden for My slaves and I will give a ten-fold reward for each good deed.'\" [1] It is like this here, while it is Jibra'il the first time it appears in this narration, and Jibra'il is often used in the Hadith literature.

I mounted it, and Jibril was with me, and I set off. Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I did that. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Taibah, which will be the place of the emigration.' Then he said: 'Dismount and pray,' so I prayed. He said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Mount Sinai, where Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, spoke to Musa, peace be upon him.' So I dismounted and prayed, and he said: 'Do you know where you have prayed? You have prayed in Bethlehem, where 'Eisa, peace be upon him, was born.' Then I entered Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) where the Prophets, peace be upon them, were assembled for me, and Jibril brought me forward to lead them in prayer. Then I was taken up to the first heaven, where I saw Adam, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the second heaven where I saw the maternal cousins 'Eisa and Yahya, peace be upon them. Then I was taken up to the third heaven where I saw Yusuf, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fourth heaven where I saw Harun, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the fifth heaven where I saw Idris, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the sixth heaven where I saw Musa, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up to the seventh heaven where I saw Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Then I was taken up above seven heavens and we came to Sidrah Al-Muntaha and I was covered with fog. I fell down prostrate and it was said to me: '(Indeed) The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined upon you and your Ummah fifty prayers, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I came back to Ibrahim and he did not ask me about anything, then I came to Musa and he said: 'How much did your Lord enjoin upon you and your Ummah?' I said: 'Fifty prayers.' He said: 'You will not be able to establish them, neither you nor your Ummah. Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce it.' So I went back to my Lord and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then I came to Musa and he told me to go back, so I went back and He reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced it by ten. Then it was reduced to five prayers. He (Musa) said: 'Go back to you Lord and ask Him to reduce it, for two prayers were enjoined upon the Children of Israel but they did not establish them.' So I went back to my Lord and asked Him to reduce it, but He said: 'The day I created the heavens and the Earth, I enjoined fifty prayers upon you and your Ummah. Five is for fifty, so establish them, you and your Ummah.' I knew that this was what Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had determined so I went back to Musa, peace be upon him, and he said: 'Go back.' But I knew that it was what Allah had determined, so I did not go back",

The people all pointed to me, and they were telling the truth. He sent them all away, but kept me there and said to me: 'Stand up and call the Adhan for the Prayer.' I stood up and the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) taught me the Adhan himself. He Said, 'Say: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah, Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulallah (Allah is the Greatest,Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah,I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger Allah).'

Then he called me when I had finished saying the Adhan, and he gave me a bundle in which there was some silver. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), let me be the one doing the Adhan in Makkah.' He said: 'I command you to do so.' Then I came to 'Attab bin Asid who was the governor of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) in Makkah, and I called the Adhan for prayer with him upon the orders of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W)",

It is the narration about the man who prayed incorrectly, and in it, the Prophet instructed him:\"Then Tashhad, then say the Iqamah.\" And they say that the meaning of Tashhad here is call the Adhan. An-Nasai recorded the Hadith with different chains (1054, 1137, 1314,1315). Whereas the wording narrated by At- Tirmidhi, and the author in Al-Kubra, mentions what the author mentioned in the chapter, the other cited versions that An-Nasai in this hook quoted do not. So it is as if he narrated the chain here for Hadith, indicating the same version that At-Tirmidhi narrated, and he himself in Al-Kubra, but he did not want to narrate the actual text here. Abu Dawud also narrated it with the order for the Adhan and Iqamah, through a different route of transmission (No. 861). And it is among the proofs used for the view that the Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory - since it has been ordered in the Hadith of the one who prayed incorrectly",

When he did that, those who had stayed behind came to him and started giving their excuses, swearing by Allah. There were eighty-odd men, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) accepted what they declared and accepted their oaths of allegiance; he prayed for forgiveness for them and left whatever was in their hearts to Allah. Then when I came and greeted him, he smiled as one who is angry, then he said: 'Come here.' So I came and sat in front of him, [1] and he said: 'What kept you behind? Did you not buy a mount?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, if I were to sit before anyone other than you of those who hold high positions in this world, I would find a way to avoid his anger. I am an eloquent man but, by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a lie today to make you pleased with me, Allah would soon make you angry with me, but if I tell you the truth, it will make you angry with me, but I will still have the hope that Allah may forgive me. I have never been in a better position, physically or financially, than the time when I stayed behind and did not join you.' The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'This man has spoken the truth. Go away until Allah decides concerning you.' So I got up and went away.\" This is an abridged version of narration. [1] It is this which the author cited the narration for.

So she told him, and he made it from tamarisk wood from Al-Ghabah (a place near Al-Madinah). Then he brought it and it was sent to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), who commanded that it be set up here. Then I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ascend it and praying on it, and saying the Takbir while he was on top of it, then he bowed when he was on top of it, then he came down backward and prostrated at the base of the Minbar, then he went back. When he had finished he turned to face the people and said: 'O people, I only did this so that you can follow me in prayer and learn how I pray",

Bilal came to Abu Bakr and said to him:\"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has been delayed (there) and the time for prayer has come, will you lead the people in prayer?\" Abu Bakr said: 'Yes, if you wish.' Bilal said the Iqamah and Abu Bakr went forward and said the Takbir for the people. Then the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) came, passing through the rows (of praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr would never glance sideways in his prayer but when the people clapped so much he looked back and (ﷺ)Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) gestured to him to carry on praying. Aha Bakr raised his hands praising Allah the Mighty and Sublime, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Then the Messenger ofAllah(ﷺ) went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he turned to face the people and said: '0 people, why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever among you comes across something in the prayer should say: 'Subhan Allah' for there is none who will not turn round when they hear him saying Subhan Allah. 0 Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I gestured to you to do so?' Abu Bakr replied: 'It is not fitting for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)",

Then he said to Bilal: 'O Bilal, if the time for Asr comes and I have not come back, then tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' When the time (for Asr) came, Bilal called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, then he said to Abu Bakr: 'Go forward. So Abu Bakr went forward and started to pray. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and started passing through the rows of people until he stood behind Abu Bakr, and the people clapped. Abu Bakr was such that whenever he started praying, he would never glance sideways, but when he noticed that the clapping persisted he turned around. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured to him to carry on praying. Abu Bakr praised Allah the Mighty and Sublime for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having told him to continue. Then Abu Bakr moved backward on his heels, and when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saw that, he came forward and led the people in prayer. When he completed the prayer he said: 'O Abu Bakr, when I gestured to you, what kept you from continuing (to lead the people)?' He said: 'It does not befit the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in prayer.' And he (the Prophet) said to the people: 'If you notice something (during the prayer), men should say Subhan Allah and women should clap",
